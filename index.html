                            <p>
                                I completed my Secondary School Certificate (SSC)
                                 from the Jessore Board in Bangladesh, 
                                 specializing in the Science department, 
                                 where I achieved a GPA of 5. During my 
                                 studies, I developed a strong passion for 
                                 subjects like mathematics, physics, and
                                  Bangla. These subjects not only sharpened 
                                  my analytical and problem-solving skills 
                                  but also deepened my interest in logical 
                                  reasoning and language comprehension, 
                                  which have been foundational to my 
                                  career in software engineering.

                                In 2015, I successfully completed my Higher Secondary

                                (ICT) grew significantly, becoming one of my favorite subjects. 
                                ICT allowed me to explore the ever-evolving world of technology,
                                 and it played a crucial role in shaping my decision to pursue a
